# EDOPro [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/edo9300/ygopro.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/edo9300/ygopro)

EDOPro is one of the bleeding-edge forks of the [YGOPro client](https://github.com/Fluorohydride/ygopro). YGOPro is powered by [YGOPro core](https://github.com/Fluorohydride/ygopro-core), an automated scripting engine for the Yu-Gi-Oh! Official Card Game.

Due to many recent changes in EDOPro and its [core](https://github.com/edo9300/ygopro-core) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/edo9300/ygopro-core.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/edo9300/ygopro-core), it is incompatible with any other simulator not based off this fork.
